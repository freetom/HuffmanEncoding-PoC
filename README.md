# HuffmanEncoding-PoC
C++ PoC implementation of lossless Huffman Encoding

Print info on what is the outcome of compression. In detail:<br/>
-Print frequencies of symbols of the alphabet of the file<br/>
-Print new encoding for each symbol<br/>
-Print initial file size and compressed file size and compression ratio<br/>



Summary of an execution on "divina_commedia.txt":

  Outcome of huffman compression:
	  Initial weight of file: 551846 bytes
	  Weight after Huffman Compression: 309978 bytes
	  The final file scale 56.171196% respect to the initial file; without calculating compression meta-info weight
